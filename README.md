An online tank war game that I'm developing using **Photon** and **Unity**. 2 tanks fight in an arena.
There are various features in the arena. Users try to gain superiority by using these features. Also, the arena is randomly generated each time.

## Features

Laser | Shotgun | Speed | Shield

* **Laser:** When the user gets this feature, they get a weapon with a very fast bullet with 1 shot.
* **Shotgun:** When the user gets this feature, they get 3 shots, slow bullets, and a gun that fires a lot of bullets per shot.
* **Speed:** When the user gets this feature, it moves fast for 5 seconds.
* **Shield:** When the user gets this feature, they take no damage for 5 seconds and have a shield that sends back bullets that land on them.
